## mmmovies-build-db

### Description
building a database for the Mmmovies project.


### History
this was originally a project that i implemented in Drupal / PHP, it was good fun to work on and refine over time (as i was learning and improving my skills in those disciplines), as i don't use either of those tools these days i thought it would be a fun project to re-implement in nodejs / javascript, for the same reasons really.. _i want to improve my ability with these new tools_.

here are the original files in a [gist](https://gist.github.com/joates/3cf7e514a05393e892f8), it worked really well & i still have an instance running on some home server that i don't use much anymore, i just found it difficult to maintain and extend with new functionality, that is (for me) the curse of Drupal.. you can get a project started really _fast_ but as it grows in complexity the Drupal framework actually begins to hinder development, it becomes very frustrating because you end up investing a lot of time and not making much progress because Drupal makes many assumptions and once you start breaking them or trying to work around them Drupal starts freaking out. (search google for ["Drupal WSOD"](http://www.google.com/?q=drupal+wsod#q=drupal+wsod)).
